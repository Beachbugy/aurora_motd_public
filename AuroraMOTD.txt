- When the mayor declares the government either "Pure" or "Corrupt" the government follows a certain play style dictated by the definition of either "Pure" or "Corrupt".

*Corruption Rules*
- If you choose to be corrupt, you must change your job to state you are corrupt. (e.g., /job Corrupt CP)
- Corrupt players may be demoted if caught being corrupt. (Taking bribes, letting crimes slide, etc.)
